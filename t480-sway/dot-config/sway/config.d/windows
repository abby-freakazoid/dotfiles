 #           specific to Wayland applications.

 #       class
 #           Compare value against the window class. Can
 #           be a regular expression. If value is __fo‐
 #           cused__, then the window class must be the

# at about 65% the background and foreground fight for attention
# 70% is ok for serious work
# 60% is great for showin off my background

# for terminal 65% is great if fonts are excluded from dimming (ie terminal itself sets opacity, not sway)
# for normal applications like mpv where this is not the case:
# - 70% is not enough
# - 80% is almost enough
# - 85% also isnt there yet
# - 90% almost
# - 95% has watermark qualities but is still too strong
# - 97% is still quite noticable
# actually, its just a bad idea to let the bg bleed thru image / video displayers in general
