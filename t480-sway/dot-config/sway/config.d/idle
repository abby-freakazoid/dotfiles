# IDLE CONFIG
# ===========
# NOTE: you gotta close outta sway n reopen it. it wont apply changes for this on config reload

# exec swayidle -w \
	#   timeout 10 '~/.local/bin/idle-audio.sh suspend' resume '~/.local/bin/idle-audio.sh resume'  # 450 = 7.5m
		# before-sleep 'swaylock -f -c 000000' \
	# timeout 3600 'systemctl suspend' \

# 2 mins too fast
# 5 mins too fast

# actually, i dont want my PC to timeout automatically. ill tell it to lock when i wanna.
# its easy with the shortcut now

# exec swayidle -w \
#     timeout $((10*60))   'swaylock -f -c 000000' \
#     timeout $((10*60+5)) 'swaymsg "output * dpms off"' resume 'swaymsg "output * dpms on"'

# swayidle -w & swaylock -f is a necessary combo of flags

# time is in seconds
# after 10 mins, turn screen off
# 10 mins is too short
exec swayidle -w \
    timeout $((15*60)) 'swaymsg "output * dpms off"' \
    resume             'swaymsg "output * dpms on"'

# two processes are needed to be able to target seperately with SIGUSR1

# after an hour, lock and suspend
exec swayidle -w \
    timeout $((60*60)) 'swaylock -f -c 000000; loginctl suspend' \
    resume             'swaymsg "output * dpms on"'  # just in case
    

# This will lock your screen after 15 minutes of inactivity, then turn off
# your displays after another 300 seconds, and turn your screens back on when
# resumed. It will also lock your screen before your computer goes to sleep.
